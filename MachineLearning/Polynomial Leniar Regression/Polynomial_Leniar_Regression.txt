Mathematical Equation of Multiple Leniar regression
	y = b0 + b1*x1 + b2*x2 + b3*X3 + categorical_var
	if there is cat_var then we need to create dummy variables
	y = b0 + b1*x1 + b2*x2 + b3*X3 + b4*D1 + b4*D2
	we have replaced all category variable with Dummy variable and equ changes to above.
		We should not include all the Dummy Vairables

Dummy Variable Trap:
If there are 2 categories (like yes/no or girls/boys or states)    
    We should not include both Dumy variables
    If we create a n dummy variables then we should include n-1 dummy variables
    it is because of multiple leniarity 


How to build models step step:
    Why to eliminate some of the variables

5 Methods to select a Model:
    1. All in
    2. Backward Elimination
    3. Forward selection
    4. Bi-Directional Elimination
    5. score comparision
 
    All-In : 
	+++++++++++++++++++++
	Use all the variables based on prior knowledge or already provided
    Backward Elimination:(step by step method)
        1. select significance level
        2. fit the full model with all possible predictors
        3. Consider the predictor with highest P-value. If P>SL goto 4 else goto FIN
        4. Remove the predictor
        5. Fit the model without variable and we should rebuild the model again
        after rebuilding the model we have to goto 3 and repeat
        FIN : Model ready
    Forward Selection:
	+++++++++++++++++++++
        1. Select a significance level to enter a model
        2. Fit all the simple regression models(i.e create simple model for all the dependent variable) y~xn and then select the model with lowest P-val
        3. We will keep th variable and fit all possible models with one extra predictor added to the we already have
           ie contruct all possible "2 variable" LR models with the selected variable + other variable separately
        4. Consider the predictor with lowest P-value. If P<SL go to step3 and make the model with 3 variable LR models

        So basically we will create LR model with 1 variable and select the variable with lowest P-val
        Then make 2 variable LR with "selected var" and then keep the "selected var" in step  1 and the one with lowest P-val in step2
        same with the 3 var , 4 var
        Continue till all the variables are exhausted growing at one variable at a time
		keep prev model
    Bi-Directional Model:
	+++++++++++++++++++++
		1.select the entry SL and stay SL 
		2. Perform all the Forward Elimination steps
		3. Perform all the backward Elimination steps.
		Repeat 2 and 3 till no variable can enter or stay
	All Possible Models:
	+++++++++++++++++++++
		1. select the criterion of goodness of fit
		2. Construct all the possible regression models 2^n-1 (if there are n var) total combinations
		3. select the one with best criterion

	Conclusion:
